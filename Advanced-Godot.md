Todo list :

- For each button, redirect to a scene or make an appropriate action

***_TIPS_***

- *Do you know VBoxContainer ? Redirection ?*

## Settings

We have menu but no settings ?
We want a setting page where we can change at least music volume and the window size.
You can add any editable game value in settings.

- Create a "Settings" scene
- Add a sound slider
- Add the possibility to change the window size
- Add a "Settings" button in menu and an access in the game scene
- Create a return button (and adapte the redirection with the parent scene)

***_TIPS_***

- *Try to go in and out your settings page. Your settings are okay ?*
- *Do you know Slider? Bus volume?*

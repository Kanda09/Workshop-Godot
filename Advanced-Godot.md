# Workshop - Godot Avanc√©

## What is Godot

Godot is a free and open source game engine to develop and create 2D and 3D games, that can be played in linux, windows and even in web !
But you already know ~( \*O*)~

## Menu

To make it's better to have at first a Menu !

Do you remember scene ?

Todo list :

- Create a "Menu" scene
- Create Title Game Label
- Create Play, Qredits, Quit button
- For each button, redirect to a scene or make an appropriate action

***_TIPS_***

- *Do you know VBoxContainer ? Redirection ?*

## Settings

We have menu but no settings ?
We want a setting page where we can change at least music volume and the window size.
You can add any editable game value in settings.

- Create a "Settings" scene
- Add a sound slider
- Add the possibility to change the window size
- Add a "Settings" button in menu and an access in the game scene
- Create a return button (and adapte the redirection with the parent scene)

***_TIPS_***

- *Try to go in and out your settings page. Your settings are okay ?*
- *Do you know Slider? Bus volume?*
